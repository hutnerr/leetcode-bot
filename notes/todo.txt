Features I Want
1. 5 customizable problems that can be set
    - store serverID, problemID, dow, hour, interval, variable difficulty
    - multiple days of the week
    - one set time (I.E. 6:15am)
    - variable difficulty (easy,med,hard)
    - include premium problems
2. Customizable server settings
    - Store serverID, channelID, timezone, etc
    - The channel to output to
    - Server participate in the "official" LC daily?
    - Allow duplicate problems?
    - Allow SQL / JS / etc problems?
3. Customizable user settings
    - Leetcode User name
4. Points system when users /submit
    - store "active" problems within a server
    - allow users to /submit


- UI folder for the discord UI
- cogs folder for the commands

-----------------------------------
it is going to be complicated managing the buckets after theyre loading
ie adding and removing after initialization
the easiest way is likely to give each of the servers a reference to the buckets
then remove the related server when editing/adding 
or maybe just know i have to do this, and call remove before i call add on the server
this second approach is likely better

i also need to redesign the problem notifs to account for days of the week
it wont be that bad since problems can only be set for one day of the week
maybe the easiest way to do this is to make a day of the week bucket,
which then has problembuckets inside of it. 

i dont know how the server notification is going to actually work. 
maybe i can import discord and do it there?
maybe i can just pass the function call along to the cog or something?


------------------------------------
maybe i could redesign the structure
server package, problem package, ?
