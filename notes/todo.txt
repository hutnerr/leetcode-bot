Features I Want
1. 5 customizable problems that can be set
    - store serverID, problemID, dow, hour, interval, variable difficulty
    - multiple days of the week
    - one set time (I.E. 6:15am)
    - variable difficulty (easy,med,hard)
    - include premium problems
2. Customizable server settings
    - Store serverID, channelID, timezone, etc
    - The channel to output to
    - Server participate in the "official" LC daily?
    - Allow duplicate problems?
    - Allow SQL / JS / etc problems?
3. Customizable user settings
    - Leetcode User name
4. Points system when users /submit
    - store "active" problems within a server
    - allow users to /submit

- UI folder for the discord UI
- cogs folder for the commands

-----------------------------------
make contest manager, handle the bucket managing there too 
ensure that when changing a bucket it must remove the old one as well 
to make sure there are no duplicates

maybe i can add helper methods to the QueryManager which make it simpler and more direct
ie a getProblemInfo method which calls performQuery internally

implement the duplicate problem setting
adds to duplicate when handle problem is called in server

handle problem for the server more than likely is going to just have to take in the slug
and then do something with it as opposed to the problem object

i dont know how the server notification is going to actually work. 
maybe i can import discord and do it there?
maybe i can just pass the function call along to the cog or something?

after a little more setup, make some testing things then run it overnight in a while loop to see 
if it actually handles it all
