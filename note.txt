when i add points or whatever, make sure its done to the object
then saved to file so its updated in both life and saved memory

try and go for more conformity. maybe similar to the error embed, have a general msg embed or something
make everything consistent, then look over everything for polish

@app_commands.describe(pid="The problem ID to delete")
@app_commands.rename(pid="problemid")

so the error handler isnt working
needs to work on admin failure
isnt working on something like when a user needs to set the timezone either, just failing

check interaction status on things to see if its been interacted already or nah

implement the timezone to utc conversion or problem change
implement the using alert role

go through all things and ensure im using the synchronizer where i should be

get the active problems and submitter working 

everything in talko

make the mini embed and make all the styling consistent

fill out the rest of the help commands

put the PositiveEmebed everywhere

fix the timezone not set being thrown by pconfig to gracefully

when setting the timezone, convert it then store it, but this also means whenver i get it, i have to convert it back. 

implement using the alert role on notification alerts

red = bad 
yellow = warn
green = success/good 
blue = general 
yellow = lc specific
