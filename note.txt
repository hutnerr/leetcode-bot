when i add points or whatever, make sure its done to the object
then saved to file so its updated in both life and saved memory

try and go for more conformity. maybe similar to the error embed, have a general msg embed or something
make everything consistent, then look over everything for polish

whats left:
- pinfo, pconfig, pactive
- the submit function in competition.py
- the bucket looping in looper.py
- add all the commands to the help
- native testing and code review 
- documentation and comments
