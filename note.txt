when i add points or whatever, make sure its done to the object
then saved to file so its updated in both life and saved memory

try and go for more conformity. maybe similar to the error embed, have a general msg embed or something
make everything consistent, then look over everything for polish

whats left:
- pinfo, pconfig, pactive
- the submit function in competition.py
- the bucket looping in looper.py
- add all the commands to the help
- native testing and code review 
- documentation and comments


@app_commands.describe(pid="The problem ID to delete")
@app_commands.rename(pid="problemid")


so the error handler isnt working
needs to work on admin failure
isnt working on something like when a user needs to set the timezone either, just failing

check interaction status on things to see if its been interacted already or nah

implement the timezone to utc conversion or problem change
implement the using alert role
