# remember to perform admin checks on the setting commands 

# /toggleroles command
# change if you want the server to have roles that get @ messages. 
# create and assign them when toggled initially. if toggled off delete the roles. 
# perform an admin check, same as settings. since creating roles probably needs admin, 
# make this command perform a self admin check, if it doesnt have it, give an ephemeral 
# back that says give me admin pls so i can do this.
