## Overview
The goal of this bot is to encourage and enable LeetCoding within a Discord server. It achieves through the use of distributing personalized reoccurring server problems.

These problems can be configured to be sent out on specific days of the week at specific times. The difficulty as well as if selection of premium problems can also be configured.

Besides the configurable problems, the bot also provides a more baseline set of features. Such as the ability to receive a notification based on how far away a contest is, notifications for the official daily problem, as well as notifications for when the contests become active.

This was a personal project and has no official affiliation with LeetCode.
