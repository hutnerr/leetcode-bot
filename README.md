# Currently Going Through an Entire Rewrite!

## Overview
The purpose of this bot is to encourage and enable LeetCoding within a Discord server. It achieves through the use of personalized server daily problems. Meaning that the server can select a set difficulty, the time it will be posted, if premium problems are included, and more. 

There is also other functionality that will notify the server about upcoming contests. The timing of these notifications can be set and modified. 

By default nothing is turned on. You must use the `/settings` command to set the server's config.
