    - toggleRoles(): Turns on roles
        - on
            - Turns on the role flag
            - Creates a role and adds it to all opted users in the server

    - Needs to account for the prod type 

# opt command
# lets the user opt into / out of an event. works as a toggle. 
# can opt into the problems or opt into the contests. 
# output that signals the change should be ephemeral. 
# will add / remove a role if roles are active. 
# sends an error if server isn't setup.

5. Looper Updates
    - Contest reminders
    - Official dailies reminders 
    - I should be able to make my notifier general enough to handle both of these 

7. UI Elements
    - Prod Selector
        - roles <- toggleroles. 
        - individual @messages
        - none
    - Problem Config Selector 
        - Unsure if I want to select for an individual problem or all at once. 
        - Allows the selection of multiple values for a difficulty string. i.e. if you have dif easy and med select its 1,2
    - Contest Alert Selector 
        - Multiple select window
        - First field is which contest 
        - Select all of the possible times the server should have enabled 

8. Discord Commands
    - The Discord Commands themselves 


I want to redesign the active problems and not increment when they're made
but I instead want problems to be toggleable, therefore ill have to add a boolean on/off to the problems table 
and track when a problem is on or off to decide to send it.

I NEED MORE ERROR CHECKING AND HANDLING IN ALL THE CODE!!!!!!!!!!
